# 04/27-higher-order-component

This project is all about using Higher Order Components (HOCs) to manage and pass down any data (in our case it'll be user data) in a React application. I will be working on implementing a User Provider HOC that can be used to pass down user information to components throughout the application.

I will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/). and will use [https://randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) api for user fetching.
